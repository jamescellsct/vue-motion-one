[Vue Motion One](https://github.com/wobsoriano/vue-motion-one) is a wrapper over [Motion One](https://motion.dev/), an animation library, built on the Web Animations API for the smallest filesize and the fastest performance.

All main concepts are inherited from the main package. Please also check the [motion one docs](https://motion.dev/).
